Genetic Algorithm

Introduction:

  This is an implementation of a Genetic Algorithm inside a Control Command system. This goal here is to minimize the number of controlers inside the environment. We use a Fitness function aswell as an Unfitness function to determine the likeliness of a population to be a good fit.
